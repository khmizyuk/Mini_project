<h1>Final project: School Science Fair</h1>

Fundamentals of eXtended Reality – Master HCI – Université Paris-Saclay

September - October 2024

Students:

Constance ARNOUX

The project is school exhibition in a park. 

Interactions:

1. Rocket launching </br>
To launch the rocket press Launch button. The sound will appear to demonstrate the process. Timer with approximate time to reach orbit of either the Moon or Earth start according to selected gravity. Reset button place the rocket to the initial position.

2. Changing of the gravity </br>
To change gravity constant, press Moon or Earth button to set gravitation to -1.68 or -9.81 accordingly. All objects will reflect the change.

3. Moving objects with ray casting at an offset distance </br>
There is a chance to grab object form the table. A cube and a bouncing ball can be moved on the scene and act according to the physics laws. Initial positions of these objects are a bit above the table to demonstrate physic. Reset button place these objects on their initial position.

4. Lighting controlled during the interaction – day/night changes </br>
In order to change day to night and night to day click on Night/Day buttons accordingly. The light of the scene will be changed.

5. Virtual navigation by touch pad using flying metaphor </br>
Within a touchpad on the remote control you can “fly” on the scene to change position.
